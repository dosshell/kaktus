Kaktus
=====
The Kaktus browser

What it is
----------
Kaktus is a minimalist webbrowser based on webkit. It targets platforms which uses tile based windows managers (eg. awesome).

What it isn't
-------------
Your mum. Really it's not your mum. It can't do all the food in the world nor can it do everything you like. It does what it does and nothing more. 

Usage
-----
Just open the configfile and i'm sure you will figure the rest out.
